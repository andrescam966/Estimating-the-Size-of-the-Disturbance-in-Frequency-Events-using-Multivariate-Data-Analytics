# Estimating-the-Size-of-the-Disturbance-in-Frequency-Events-using-Multivariate-Data-Analytics
Microgrids face frequency stability challenges, especially after disturbances like generation loss. This study presents a methodology to estimate disturbance size during frequency events, applied in the Santa Cruz â€“ Baltra microgrid using multiple linear regression and Monte Carlo simulations.
